        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Please fill out the application to volunteer
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc03UKGSBM5psfpFzPIuUdTt0hI7G4OCXo1gd9BO17rH8qbLA/viewform"
               target="_blank">HERE</a>. Volunteers must be 14 or older, and volunteers under 18 will be required to have
            their parent or guardian sign a <a href="dps_volunteer_minor_release.pdf" target="_blank">minor release form</a>.
            We require that all volunteers commit to coming out to adoption events at least one day a month (preferably
            more) and stay for the full day (10am to 4pm on Saturdays, 11am to 4pm on Sundays). You MUST sign up to
            attend events before coming out. Please email Rachel 3-5 days before an event to confirm your spot, and read
            through the Volunteer email that will be sent out on Fridays to learn your assignment!
          </p>

          <p>
            DPS Rescue volunteers are an important part of our organization, and learning to be a strong volunteer takes
            hard work and dedication. We are looking for volunteers with a passion for dogs and rescue rather than those
            who simply need to earn community service hours for school. The volunteer coordinator will not sign off on
            any volunteer hours until you have demonstrated and have indicated a plan to demonstrate ongoing commitment
            to the rescue.
          </p>

          <p>
            All volunteers will begin at the level of "Pooper Scooper (novice)." As you attend more events and gain
            experience, you will move up to the level of "Puppy Minder." Experienced regular volunteers will be promoted
            to the position of "Volunteer Ambassador." Ambassadors will be responsible for training and supervising new
            volunteers.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information, read the Q&A below and contact Rachel, the volunteer coordinator, at
            <a href="mailto:rachel@dpsrescue.com" target="_blank">rachel@dpsrescue.com</a> if you have more questions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">What will I be doing?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Before adoptions start, we set up dog pens, hang signs, organize materials, and prepare for the van to
            arrive. Once the van arrives, all dogs need to be walked and then put in their proper pens. Puppies are
            carried in and will need to be cleaned up after. During adoptions, we need people to talk to potential
            adopters, clean up after the dogs, clean the van, play with dogs, and sit with the puppies. Once
            adoptions are over, we need to break down pens, remove signs, pack up supplies, and leave the store
            and outside area as clean as we found it.
          </p>

          <p>
            Make sure to read our <a href="">FAQ</a> so you will be able to speak about our organization. It covers
            topics like our adoption fee, fostering, and vaccinations.
          </p>

        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Dog walking</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Only our adult dogs walk on leash; the puppies are too young. When you are given a dog to walk, make sure
            you put your hand through the loop of the leash and hang on tight--some of our dogs are strong! Walk them
            around and make sure they pee and poop before you put them into the adult dog pen. We will give you bags
            so make sure you pick up their poop (not only is it illegal to leave it, we want to make sure the stores and
            their neighbors want us to come back! If you are not comfortable walking a certain dog, let us know and we
            will assign you to a different dog.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">The adult pen</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Once an adult dog has been walked, it goes into the adult pen. Volunteers in this area will generally be talking
            to adopters, walking dogs, and cleaning up after them.
          </p>

          <p>
            In order for a potential adopter to walk a dog, they must leave their ID at the front table. When they leave their
            ID, they will be handed a leash to bring over to the volunteers in the pens. If someone does not have a leash
            from the front table, they cannot walk a dog! When they return the dog to the pen, they should return the leash
            to the front table to get their ID back.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Puppies</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Puppies do not go for walks since they have not had all their shots so are not protected from deadly diseases
            like parvo. They go straight from the van into the puppy pens and should only be handled by people who have
            WASHED THEIR HANDS.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Ew, I don't want to clean up pee or poo!</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Unfortunately, it comes with the territory. You may not want to clean it up, but think about the poor dog who
            has to sit in it and the people who have to make the long drive in the van. We will provide cleaning supplies
            and gloves upon request.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Is there a minimum age for volunteers?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Yes. Volunteers must be at least 14 years old and have signed permission of a parent or guardian.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Will you sign my form for school credit?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Our volunteer coordinator will only sign off on forms once she determines that you have demonstrated and
            will continue to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to DPS. Please email
            <a href="mailto:rachel@dpsrescue.com" target="_blank">rachel@dpsrescue.com</a> if you have
            questions about this policy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="question">Is that everything I need to know?</h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Probably not. One of the most fun things about our events is you never know what will come up! If you have
            a questions at an event, or need to report something, please find Rachel or send her an email at
