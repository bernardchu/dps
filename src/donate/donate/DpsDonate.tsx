          <p>As a non-profit, we rely on community donations to continue to save dogs and support those we already have. The average cost per dog to get them adoption ready is $467, which includes bailing them out of the shelter, a health check, spay or neuter surgery, vaccinations, microchipping and spending several weeks at a foster home to evaluate before adoption.</p>
          <p>If you would like to support our rescue, donations are always accepted. Donations can be made in the monetary form and they can be tangible items. Every penny helps.</p>
