Our fosters enable us to rescue more dogs, they teach our animals what being in a home is like, they provide valuable information about the pups to potential adopters, and they advocate for their fosters by finding potential homes or just telling people about their awesome foster dogs.</p>',

We ask for a minimum of a two week foster commitment when you sign on to take a dog or puppy. Occasionally we are in need of short-term fosters (when other fosters go out of town, or in case of emergency), so if you're only able to keep for a few days, please feel free to fill out the application and join our team!</p>"

Remove anything that a dog might chew on from the dog's reach. Plan out where the dog will eat and sleep. And be sure to let us know that this is your first experience with a dog so we can assign you an appropriate foster.</p>"
